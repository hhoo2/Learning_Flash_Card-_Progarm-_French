# Flashy Flashcard Program

The Flashy Flashcard Program is a simple Python script that allows you to learn and practice French and English words using flashcards. It's an alternative to platforms like Quizlet, providing a basic flashcard-based vocabulary learning experience. You can also use your own words by customizing the CSV file.

## Features

- Display random flashcards with French words.
- Automatically flip the flashcards to show English translations.
- Mark words as known or unknown.
- Save your progress in a CSV file for future review.

## Usage

- The script displays a flashcard with a French word.
- After 3 seconds, the card automatically flips to show the English translation.
- Click the checkmark button if you know the word or the cross button if you don't.
- Your progress will be saved in the "words_to_learn.csv" file and you will be able to continue your progress next time you use the program.

## Customizing

You can customize the "french_words.csv" file with your own word pairs, or you can even import your own CSV file. Here's how you can customize your flashcards:

1. **Editing the CSV File:**
   - Open the "french_words.csv" file in a text editor or spreadsheet software.
   - Replace the existing word pairs with your own. Each row should have two columns: the first column for words to learn and the second column for definitions or translations in any language or subject you want to learn.

2. **Importing Your Own CSV File:**
   - If you have a separate CSV file with your word pairs, you can import your own csv file. Make sure that the format of your CSV file matches the script's expectations (first column for words to learn, and the second column for definitions or translations). Also, make sure to change the name of the file with your file name in "main.py"

By customizing the CSV file and updating the Python script, you can create flashcards with vocabulary that suits your specific needs and interests.
